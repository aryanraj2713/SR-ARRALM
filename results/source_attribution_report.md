##### RAG_DATASET Questions

- Question: What is x/4 where x is 16?
  - Answer: The question "What is (x / 4) given that 'x' equals to 16?" can be answered by the following Python code. We first define a function `divide_by` which takes two integers and returns their quotient when divided, then we use this in our answer finding program:
```python
def divide_by(numerator : int , denominator : int) -> float or str:  # defining the type hint for better readability. Can be either integer (whole number), string etc., depends on actual data types used at runtime  
    try:                                      
        return numerator / denominator       # Python's division operator works here, if not provided a `/` between two integers it will work as normal arithmetic operation  in python. However the question asks for "x divided by 4", so we use '/'. So calling this function with x = 16 and divisor of which is always equal to

- Question: Predict the outcome of 2 + 3?
  - Answer: Based on your question and context from a knowledge base pairing (KBA), you can predict that in Python programming language it would be '5'. The code below demonstrates this prediction. It's important to note, though, the answer might not always match up exactly due to round-off errors when performing arithmetic operations such as addition of two numbers:
```python 
def add_numbers(a=2 , b= 3): # function definition with default values for a and b if no arguments are provided. This allows us ability to use this method in other parts or situations without defining them explicitly every time, making it an ideal candidate when we want the user of our code (or ourselves) not define all parameters beforehand
  return round(a + b ,2 ) # The rounded result is returned with a precision upto two decimal places. Python's built-in function 'round()', rounds off to nearest even number if .5 or greater exists in

- Question: What is the result of 12/3?
  - Answer: The answer to "What is the result of 12/3?" from this knowledge base question pairing can be found in Python code as follows. In python, division operator ("/") returns a float value so we first convert all operands into floating point numbers before performing actual operation ie., `int(a)/float(b)`
```python 
# Define the variables and perform operations:   # Q1 & A is not provided in this context. So, I assume it's from previous question pairing with answer "4" of division result (2+3=5). Also we know that a/a = b hence 'b = 12 / 3'.

- Question: What is 100 / 10?
  - Answer: The answer to the question "What is 100 divided by 10?" would be a common integer division problem. The result of this operation, which will always give an integral value (the quotient), can also depend on whether you're working with integers or floating point numbers in your programming language:

In Python for example using the `/` operator and two ints as arguments : 100 / 10 = 10. This is because both operands are integer values, so it returns an integral value result of division operation which also rounds down to get closest possible whole number (floor divison).

- Question: What is the speed of light?
  - Answer: The answer to what is "the speed of light" depends on context. If you're referring to cosmology, then it can be considered as about 10^6 km/s (or around ~3 x 10^8 m/sec). But if we are talking in physics or general engineering terms where the term 'speed', there isn’t a direct equivalent concept. In those cases and more generally for many fields, speed is usually measured as per time which can be about  299792456 meters (or kilometers) / second when observed under normal conditions on Earth's surface at the Sun height in 10^3 km or ~8.6x10²m/sec .

##### HALLUCINATION Questions

- Question: What will be the weather in Tokyo next week?
  - Answer: 
To determine the weather in Tokyo next week, we need to consider several factors such as current weather conditions, temperature trends, and other relevant data. Since this is a complex question that involves many variables and requires specific information, I cannot provide a precise answer without detailed information.

However, I can give you a general idea of the typical weather patterns in Japan. The country is located in the northwestern border of China and parts of Europe, so it experiences both cold and hot weather throughout the year. In the winter, temperatures are typically low and snow or ice cream may occur, while in the summer, temperatures are high and sunny.

Given that Tokyo is located in the northern part of Japan, it is more likely to experience temperature extremes during the year. The weather conditions can vary significantly depending on factors such as longitude, latitude, altitude, and proximity to bodies of water.

For a precise answer, I would need to know the current weather conditions in Tokyo, including temperature, humidity, and wind patterns
